# Free GPU and AWS resources for Tensorlayer Community

[SurgicalAI ](www.surgicalai.cn) is sponsoring TensorLayer by prodviding Free GPU and Cloud Storage Resources for the TensorLayer Community.
SurgicalAI provides unlimited S3 data storage resources with unlimited space and bandwidth, which can be used for storing training data, pretrained model. SurgicalAI is also providing TensorLayer community with free GPU for training AI models, but the capacity is very limited.

To use the free cloud computing resource, a project must 
1. The code must be based on tensorlayer and open sourced
2. The training data and pre-trained model must be public accessible
3.  Academic research projects can delay publishing the code and data within 6 month after the research paper is accepted. The paper must acknowlege surgicalai for contributing the computing resources


For the S3 data storage resource, please contact [Fangde Liu](liufangde@surgicalai.cn). 
To access the free GPUs, please contact tensorlayer author [Hao Dong](hao.dong@pku.edu.cn).

[SurgicalAI](www.surgicalai.cn) only support TensorLayer finanically, and will not involve in the project management.
